    <h1> A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace <br> 1996  </h1>

    <p class="line-1 anim-typewriter"> Governments of the Industrial World , you weary giants of  </p>


    <p class="line-1 line-2 anim-typewriter">flesh and steel , I come from Cyberspace , the new home of  </p>


    <p class="line-1 line-3 anim-typewriter">Mind.On behalf of the future,I ask you of the past to leave </p>

    <p class="line-1 line-4 anim-typewriter">us alone.You are not welcome among us. You have no soverei- </p>

    <p class="line-1 line-5 anim-typewriter">gnty where we gather.We have no elected government, nor are </p>

   <p class="line-1 line-6 anim-typewriter"> we likely to have one,so I address you with no greater auth-</p>

   <p class="line-1 line-7 anim-typewriter"> ority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I  </p>

   <p class="line-1 line-8 anim-typewriter">declare the global social space we are building to be natur-</p>

  <p class="line-1 line-9 anim-typewriter">rally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us.</p>

  <p class="line-1 line-10 anim-typewriter">You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any  </p>

  <p class="line-1 line-11 anim-typewriter"> methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear. Govern-</p>

  <p class="line-1 line-12 anim-typewriter">ments derive their just powers from the consent of the gove</p>

  <p class="line-1 line-13 anim-typewriter">rned. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did  </p>

  <p class="line-1 line-14 anim-typewriter">not invite you.You do not know us,nor do you know our world.</p>

  <p class="line-1 line-15 anim-typewriter">Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think  </p>

  <p class="line-1 line-16 anim-typewriter">that you can build it,as though it were a public construct- </p>

  <p class="line-1 line-17 anim-typewriter">ion project.You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows</p>

  <p class="line-1 line-18 anim-typewriter">itself through our collective actions. You have not engaged </p>

  <p class="line-1 line-19 anim-typewriter">in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create </p>

  <p class="line-1 line-20 anim-typewriter">the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture,</p>
  <p class="line-1 line-21 anim-typewriter">our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-22 anim-typewriter">society more order than could be obtained by any of your im-</p>
  <p class="line-1 line-23 anim-typewriter">positions. You claim there are problems among us that you   </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-23 anim-typewriter">need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our</p>
  <p class="line-1 line-24 anim-typewriter">precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-25 anim-typewriter">are real conflicts,where there are wrongs, we will identify </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-26 anim-typewriter">them and address them by our means. We are forming our own  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-27 anim-typewriter">Social Contract.This governance will arise according to the </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-28 anim-typewriter">conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different. </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-29 anim-typewriter">Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-30 anim-typewriter">is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-31 anim-typewriter">may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race,  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-32 anim-typewriter">economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-33 anim-typewriter">creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-34 anim-typewriter">her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-35 anim-typewriter">coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-36 anim-typewriter">property, expression, identity, movement,and context do not </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-37 anim-typewriter">apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no  </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-38 anim-typewriter">matter here. Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-39 anim-typewriter">we cannot obtain order by physical coercion.We believe that </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-40 anim-typewriter">that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the common </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-41 anim-typewriter">wealth, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be   </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-42 anim-typewriter">distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law </p>                                                        
  <p class="line-1 line-43 anim-typewriter">that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-44 anim-typewriter">is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our   </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-45 anim-typewriter">particular solutions on that basis.But we cannot accept the </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-46 anim-typewriter">the solutions you are attempting to impose. In the United   </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-47 anim-typewriter">States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications</p>
  <p class="line-1 line-48 anim-typewriter">Reform Act which repudiates your own Constitution and insults</p>
  <p class="line-1 line-49 anim-typewriter">the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Madison, DeToqueville, </p>
  <p class="line-1 line-50 anim-typewriter">and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us **** </p>
