      Back when I was 17 and on exchange, my friends and I decided to take a circuit trip to see more of China. We lived in the north (Harbin) so the first step was to take a train down to Beijing and meet up with some other exchange kids. Since we were underage and there were strict rules about travel, we told our host families we were visiting our friends in a town just a few hours even farther north called Jiamusi.

      <br><br>So the three of us get dropped off at the train station 15 minutes before the train to Jiamusi, planning to wait there for a few hours before the Beijing train boards. Long story short, we get a little cocky about time and end up running to our gate just 10 minutes before the train's scheduled to leave. Because it's China, where "timeliness" can go a bit too far, the train is already gone. The gate manager just laughs at us, but a young looking guy comes over, asks to look at our tickets. We hand them over, and he takes off running. We give chase, to the laughs of the gate manager and others in the area, but this dude's too fast and we lose him.

      <br><br>So there we were sitting in the train station. We can't go home, because it's not like we can say "Oh we missed the train to Jiamusi hours ago and just came back now." We couldn't afford new tickets, so we stalked the station for the guy before, in true teenage fashion, we sat ourselves down and moped.

      <br><br>Suddenly this very shady older woman leans over and whispers in my ear.

      <div class="pullquote"> "You wanna go to Beijing? I can get you there for 1/2 the price of that train." </div>

      Fool us once right? So we politely tell her we're not sure we're interested. She gets assertive, grabs me by the arm and starts pulling me up, saying she'll take us to Beijing. My friend wrestles me back, and is now way beyond suspicious. He asks her to come with him as he goes from stranger to stranger, telling our situation and asking if this woman sounded trustworthy. Some said yes, some said no.

      <br><br>Well, that was good enough for us. We follow her out of the station to an alley behind it. We stop outside a convenience store, where three big guys ask to take our bags. We're now VERY uncomfortable, and try to resist, but they snatch them and take them to the back. We're trying to ask the lady what's going on, but she just keeps telling us they work for her, it'll be fine, sit here for 45 minutes, and then gives us each a lollipop to bide our time. At that point, we were really up shit creek, so what are you gonna do? We sat down and sucked on our candy in very dejected silence. 45 minutes pass, more people are milling around. Shady lot by the look of most of them, and most didn't speak Mandarin (or English). My friend starts crying (she cried easily, but it was stressful) so the lady keeps shoving convenience store snacks on us and not leaving until we eat them. We started joking about how nice it was that the thieves and kidnappers gave us candy.

      <br><br>Then, out of fucking nowhere, I don't know how it even fit in the alley, comes a bus. There's no seats inside, but beds stacked in threes. One of the men open the bottom hatch, and there were our bags. We're told to take our shoes off, given slippers and a blanket. Turns out it was a commuter bus, actually a lot what I imagine the Knight Bus in Harry Potter was like. Over the trip, we end up having a ball with the other passengers, one of which was a very drunk worker from the far off Uyghur province who sang folk songs the whole way. Came in to Beijing with a great story.

      TLDR: Got completely scammed out of train tickets, then an old lady dragged us out of the station, big scary men stole our stuff, and it all turned out to be completely ok
