    <h1>Dead Man's Letter </h1>
    <p>
      Some friends and I were backpacking in Sicily, and met an old man in a train station. We were taking the train from Taormina to Palermo, and we sat with the old sicilian while we waited. We talked about Sicily, America, whatever; he was a very serious man who barely cracked a smile.
      <br> After an hour or so, he got up to leave. He asked us where we were going, and when we said Palermo he took out a piece of paper and wrote a note in italian. He told us to take it to a restaurant called the osteria, and give the letter to the owner. He said his name was Pietro Pugliesi, and that the owners of the restaurant would "take care of us". He then looked at us, put his thumb to his eye, and took off. 
      <br>When we got to Palermo, we headed to the restaurant. It was packed, but we went in anyway. We asked to see the owner, and after much confusion and anger from the sicilians (they thought we were just dumb americans) the owner came out. He also seemed angry for wasting his time. We told him that Pietro Pugliesi had sent us. As soon as we said his name, the owner said,
      
      <h3 class="pullquote"> This cannot be. This man is dead! </h3>
      
       <p> "This cannot be. This man is dead!" The waiter next to him crossed himself. We quickly grabbed the letter and gave it to the owner. After reading it several times, in shock, and showing it to some others, he looked at us and said to follow him. He took us to a large table in the center of the restaurant, the only available table. He took a Reserved sign off the table and said sit down. 

        <br>Within thirty seconds plates of all kinds of sicilian food were rushing out to our table, along with several bottles of wine and beer. The waiters kept coming and asking if everything was okay, what else they could bring, etc. The owner also made it a point to continually check up on us. It was incredible. At the end of the delicious meal, the owner came out with the bill. Since we were poor college students we were worried. It ended up costing about 275euro... but he looked at us and said "friends of Pietro?" and then he ripped up the check. We still believe to this day that we delivered a message for the mafia of the whereabouts and status of one Pietro Pugliesi. </p>
