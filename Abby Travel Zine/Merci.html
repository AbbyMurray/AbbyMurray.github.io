      I was on a train in Paris about this time last year, me and my friend were on our way to meet some people down at the Moulin Rouge. I was eating a cup of noodles with a fork I'd liberated from the hostel. When this lovely gent stands up to leave the train, sort of half bows with his head down and hands together and ever so gently takes my noodles from me. Says 'merci' a couple of times and departs the train.

      I wasn't even mad, it was beautiful. The way he took them was just great, one of my favourite parts of the trip. I don't know why, it just felt awesome.
