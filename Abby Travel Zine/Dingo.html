      I was camping in the outback in Australia with my buddy last summer (their winter), he took the tent and i slept in a swag bag because i'd never seen so many shooting stars in my life and it really was quite beautiful.
      <br>
      <br> So it's about three in the morning and i start hearing a howling from the hills around the campsite, like wolves howling at the moon kind of howling. So i shout to my buddy and ask him what's making the noise, he informs me that there's dingoes around here.

      <div class="pullquote"> Well what would the odds be that they'd actually come into the campsite? </div>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Around half an hour later i feel something weird sniffing around my feet, i slowly reach for the head torch i had in my pocket and shine it on my feet. There's a fucking dingo sniffing around my swag so i tell it to piss off and leave me alone.
      <br>
      <br>The fucker kept coming back with it's dingo buddies and apparently all through the night my friend could hear me muttering swear words at them, telling the "twats" to piss off. I asked a ranger the next morning if i was ever in any danger and he said no, they've just got a bit used to humans over the past couple of years.
      
      <p>they've just got a bit used to humans over the past couple of years and don't have too much fear anymore.But I'm pretty sure one of the bastards stole a sock that was drying on the cars bonnet so i was a bit peeved about that, i wonder if the Australian high commission would reimburse me the cost of a nice pair of hiking socks? </p>
