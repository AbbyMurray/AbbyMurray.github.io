    <p>
      I was in Athens last year and it was our last day there with nothing else to see. We were being told to stay out of dark alley ways because of crack heads and what not. At the time there was a lot of protests going on so some times you could hear them in the distance. So we were walking and heard all this music, singing, and yelling coming through this alley. So we ended up following it all the way through and came out between this old apartment building and the metro. All the music was coming from the building and a window was open so we decided to throw some rocks through the window to ask to come up. Thinking back on it that could of been bad but worked out good. 

      <div class="pullquote"> A guy looked out the window with a handlebar mustache and said something in Greek </div> 

      <p> and we yelled can we come up it sounds fun in there. Then he gave us a smile and said ohhh Americans ! yes yes come up my friends. when we get in there all the rooms of this apartment building were converted into recording stuidos with all different bands playing. We ended up hanging out there for about 2 hours. We didnt understand them to well and they also didnt understand us but we all knew the music so it worked out. If anyone is interested i can link the video when i get off of work.
