    Celebrate the special exhibition Roots of “The Dinner Party”: History in the Making with an evening of fun and informative history lectures about the women featured in Judy Chicago’s iconic feminist installation. These lively lectures are accompanied by a cash bar with wine and beer. Jennifer Ball, Professor of Early Christian and Byzantine Art at Brooklyn College, discusses women monastics with an emphasis on Hildegard von Bingen in honor of her place at The Dinner Party, and Abigail McGrath explores how women of color have responded to Judy Chicago’s work over time. Presented in partnership with the Society for the Advancement of Social Studies (SASS).
