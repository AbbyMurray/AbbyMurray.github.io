    <h1>Song of the Open Road</h1>
    <h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
    <p>
      Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road, <br>
      Healthy, free, the world before me, <br>
      The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.

      <br>
      <br>

      Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune, <br>
      Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,<br>
      Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms, <br>
      Strong and content I travel the open road.

       <h3 class="pullquote">  Strong and content I <br> travel the open road </h3>

      <p> 
      The earth, that is sufficient, <br>
      I do not want the constellations any nearer, <br>
      I know they are very well where they are, <br>
      I know they suffice for those who belong to them.

      <br>
      <br>

      (Still here I carry my old delicious burdens, <br>
      I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go, <br>
      I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them, <br>
      I am fillâ€™d with them, and I will fill them in return.) <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all that is here, <br>
      I believe that much unseen is also here.<br> <br>



    </p>
